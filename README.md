# taskrunner

## Features

- Runs tasks (which are defined as shell scripts)
- Ensures only one instance of a task runs at a time (globally in the whole system) - using file-based locks
- Tasks can run in parallel
- Output from parallel tasks is correctly annotated with original task name
- Output lines are timestamped
- Parallelism can be nested
  - But task name annotations are flattened, i.e. are not added repeatedly at each level
- Output from each task is also collected to a separate file, to easier debug that particular task
- Tasks can have specified inputs
  - Input can be a file, an environment variable, or result of an arbitrary command
- If a task is invoked again for the same input (on a given machine), it is not re-run
- Tasks can have specified outputs (files)
- Task outputs can be cached in an object store
- If a task is invoked with inputs for which it was already computed on CI, the result is fetched from remote cache and task is not re-run
- If a task is called multiple times in the same execution, it is only executed once.
- When running on CI:
   - Task output (stdout and stderr) is uploaded to an object store after task is finished
   - task status is reported as a GitHub _check_ for a commit
     - _pending_ while it's running
     - _success_ or _failed_ when finished
   - GitHub check details link points to the uploaded task output

- Unstable inputs (i.e. inputs that have changed during the job execution) are detected
  - TODO: do something about input-output files like package-lock.json

- Tasks can have command-line arguments
  - But some options are meant for the task runner, such as `-f`

- Can force reexecution of a specific task (excl. dependencies) (`-f`)
  - Note: in previous implementation `-f` forced reexecution of all tasks. This seems less useful, will be under another option.

- Task can be cancelled using SIGINT or SIGTERM, and state is maintained appropriately

- Fast - if there's nothing to do, returns quickly (<1s, ideally <300ms)

## Possible features

- Support stdin? For now redirected from `/dev/null`
- Quiet output like `gradle`, only report what is running and progress, not full output, and no output if nothing to do
- Marker files - additional hash file in `.stack-work`, `node_modules` etc., so that if that dir is cleared, we redo the action
  - Or: remember hash of some of the output files and check they're still there
  - Only some because there can be benign changes
- Can dump enough info to reproduce failures
  - For example: hashes of inputs, caches etc.
- Generate a trace (otlp for analysis, or render to a gantt chart)

## Things we should do better than previous version

- less confusing output for cache miss (no "error")
- ??? Something, can't recall now
- `--cmd` replaced with `--raw`, since we can't really execute in the context of the original script

## Things to handle

- Task leaks stdin/out/err handle - have a timeout on draining output
- Parallel task failed and we're killed - report status correctly
- `snapshot` - how to communicate with controller process?
  - pipe and pass fd to child process?
  - named pipe and pass name to child process via env?
- Nested tasks - each should write to original stdout
- Unmerged files when hashing
- bad usage of `snapshot` - e.g. called twice
- why `ls-tree -r` is needed - git option of quoting
- save cache tar error

## Misc TODO

- Better output of error messages (to normal streams)
- String/Text unification
- Debugging - show hash input
- More specialized tests for input handling
- In parent task's log, add reference to nested log file
- Debugging aid: when replacing saved hash, show diff between old and new hash input (or save old hash input to compare)
- Bug: pendolino sometimes rebuilds randomly with scripts/UPDATE
  - Probable cause: helper generation races with its input hashing
    - nope, it generates in another directory
- More tests for interaction between remote cache and local hash, especially:
  - restoring remote cache should also store local hash, but not store remote cache again

## Output principles (output generated by runner itself)

- "quiet" operation - no output except when an error happens
- standard operation: one "info" message when job starts (or skips), one when it ends, no more
- debug: log everything (maybe later categorize)

## Performance goals

- Previous impl no-op tests/scripts/UPDATE: ~1.6s
- Current impl no-op tests/scripts/UPDATE: ~2.3s
